# controller_configuration.job_launch

## Description

An Ansible Role to launch a job template on Ansible Controller.

## Requirements

ansible-galaxy collection install -r tests/collections/requirements.yml to be installed
Currently:
  awx.awx
  or
  ansible.controller

## Variables



### Secure Logging Variables

The following Variables compliment each other.
If Both variables are not set, secure logging defaults to false.
The role defaults to False as normally the job launch task does not include sensitive information.
controller_configuration_job_launch_secure_logging defaults to the value of controller_configuration_secure_logging if it is not explicitly called. This allows for secure logging to be toggled for the entire suite of controller configuration roles with a single variable, or for the user to selectively use it.
